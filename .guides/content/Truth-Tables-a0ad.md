You may very well have already understood everything you need to know about *AND* and *OR*. But here is the actual theory behind it that you should know.

Below are 2 examples of truth tables. Each of Input 1 and Input 2 can be any boolean expression you care to dream up.

## AND
For any 2 given inputs to a logical AND test, the following table applies.

| Input 1 | AND | Input 2 | Result |
|-|-|-|-|
| False | AND | False | **False** |
| False | AND | True | **False** |
| True | AND | False | **False** |
| True | AND | True | **True** |

As is pretty obvious, **both** inputs need to be true in order for the result to be true.

## OR
For any 2 given inputs to a logical OR test, the following table applies.

| Input 1 | OR | Input 2 | Result |
|-|-|-|-|
| False | OR | False | **False** |
| False | OR | True | **True** |
| True | OR | False | **True** |
| True | OR | True | **True** |

## Internalizing
The above really is obvious if you think about it. You use AND and OR all the time in every day speech. Make sure you are comfortable with these concepts but don't worry too much if the theory bit seems somewhat abstract.

In a moment we will do a whole series of gradually harder challenges that will help you internalize this pretty quickly so it becomes second nature.
