Each time you press the A it 'toggles' between the arrow working and not working.\n\n**Hint** you can change the value of a boolean to `False` when `True` or `True` when `False` using `boolVar = not boolVar`.",

You need to \n\n- Call the command `setOtherKeysAllowed(True)` \n- Insert an `if` statement that checks whether it `getOtherKeysAllowed()` is True\n- If it is True, then the keyboard handler should run so the 'A' moves the player left, 'D' moves right, 'W' up and 'S' down. You should insert the correct keyboard characters as upper case letters.\n\nYou will end up with an `if` within another `if` (a nested `if` statement). The nests `if` statement code block needs be indented a further 2 spaces. You can do this quickly by highlighting multiple lines of code and then pressing the TAB key to indent or Shift+TAB to outdent.\n",
